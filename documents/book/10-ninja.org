Now that you have reached the end of this book, you know enough to research, write and publish a book, dissertation, or whatever else you want to share with the world. Working your way through the {{{ews}}} (EWS) chapters, you have mastered the steepest part of the Emacs learning curve. However, after using Emacs for a while, you will undoubtedly want to fine-tune it to fit your needs. There are five stages towards becoming an Emacs ninja, the first of which you are taking right now:

1. Understand the basics
2. Modify the configuration
3. Create functions
4. Build a package
5. Help others

This final chapter puts you on a path to mastering Emacs by providing suggestions for deepening your knowledge.

* Understand the basics
EWS covers most aspects of using Emacs as far as they relate to writing prose. However, this book is not a comprehensive manual of Emacs but an opinionated description of achieving a series of tasks. The text in this book is opinionated because it describes only one method to complete each objective.

The flexible nature of Emacs means that there is always more than one way to achieve the same outcome. This freedom is both a strength and a weakness, as it can create unnecessary debates and confusion.

If, after reading this book, you would like to know more or find out about different perspectives, I recommend you read other books such as /Learning GNU Emacs/ by Debra Cameron, /Mastering Emacs/ by Mickey Petersen or the built-in Emacs manual [cite: @cameron_2005; @petersen_2022;].

Reading about Emacs is an excellent method for learning new things. Still, sometimes, you like to see somebody use the system itself. YouTube is a great place to find informative channels that discuss using Emacs, such as the highly recommended videos by Prot Stavrou and David Wilson from the System Crafters channel.

* Modify the configuration
Emacs Writing Studio uses a no-code solution by providing a thoroughly tested configuration and using the customisation front-end to configure Emacs. There will come a time when you would like to change some of the defaults directly inside the init file, which means you need to learn some Emacs Lisp.

So why would you want to configure Emacs by writing code instead of the modern graphical features provided by other programs? Commercial software provides graphical menus to define how it operates. For example, in figure [[fig-graphical-config]], you might tick a box, select an item in a list, or enter a value in a text box to configure the program according to your wishes.

#+caption: Typical graphical configuration screen.
#+name: fig-graphical-config
#+attr_html: :alt Typical graphical configuration screen :title Typical graphical configuration screen :width 80%
#+attr_latex: \textwidth
[[file:images/graphical-interface.png]]

The code below is equivalent to figure [[fig-graphical-config]]. This example determines whether Emacs shows a startup message when you first open it. The second line sets the initial scratch message. In this case, the parameter is a string of letters nested between quotation marks. The last line sets the cursor type to a bar. This variable has other predefined options, such as 'bar' or 'hollow'. It uses a single quotation mark before the text to prevent Emacs from confusing this option with a variable. Compare these lines with the image to reverse engineer the Elisp code.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no :eval no
  (setq inhibit-startup-message t
        initial-scratch-message "Hello world"
        cursor-type 'bar)
#+end_src

Notice how the whole expression is surrounded by parenthesis, typical of programming in Lisp. These parentheses can confuse beginning users when nesting code multiple levels deep. As you get used to the syntax, parentheses will become helpful markers to help you understand the logic of your code.

While on the surface, the code-based method seems more complex than ticking and writing in boxes and picking a drop-down list, it is far more potent than a graphical interface. Once you learn how to write simple Emacs Lisp, you will realise that Emacs is, in reality, the most user-friendly system possible because of the power it gives you over your computer. Using Emacs Lisp is the epitome of user-friendliness. You decide how your computer behaves instead of some software company controlling your behaviour. But with this immense power comes great responsibility and a learning curve.

The easiest way to learn Lisp to change your init file is by copying the patterns in the EWS configuration. The Appendix explains the configuration and provides some guidance on modifying it. Many Emacs users freely share their configurations, and you should feel free to copy any parts of their code. Emacs is free software in the freedom sense of the word, so use this power and learn from fellow users.

One final tip: When you copy code from other Emacs users, don't add anything to your configuration until you understand exactly what it does. Read the documentation and try some alternative versions so you fully comprehend the code.

** Modifying key sequences
Emacs ships with a range of predefined keyboard shortcuts for its core functionality and the built-in packages. Most external packages don't define key keyboard shortcuts to prevent conflicts with your configuration. The EWS configuration assigns shortcuts to the most common functions using the =C-c w= prefix. As explained in the Appendix, you can easily modify your keyboard shortcuts listed in the init file.

You can change the keyboard's behaviour at three levels: programmable keyboards, the operating system / window manager, and Emacs.

Some high-end keyboards are programmable and let you define the output of each key. For example, you could map the right control key as the Hyperkey. At the second level, your operating system interprets the input from the keyboard. For example, in Windows, =s-E= (Windows and E) opens the file explorer. You can erase this binding to make it available in Emacs. Each operating system has its own methods to change keyboard maps (keymaps). Some experienced Emacs users remap the caps lock key to act as the control key to make it easier to use and prevent a repetitive strain injury known as 'Emacs Pinky'.

Last but not least, you can define keyboard sequences within Emacs itself. The example below binds the F5 key to toggle whitespace mode. This minor mode indicates whitespace in the current buffer with characters. The =#'= characters before the function name are a technical requirement to instruct Emacs not to evaluate this function but only to store its value. If you like to remove a keystroke, just use ~nil~ as the function name.

#+begin_src elisp :tangle no
  (keymap-global-set "<f5>" #'whitespace-mode)
#+end_src

The previous example uses the global keymap, meaning the shortcut is available in all modes. You can also define a shortcut for a specific mode, which is only available when that mode is active. The example below sets the same shortcut but only applies when Org is active, so the F5 key can do something different in other modes.

#+begin_src elisp :tangle no
  (keymap-set org-mode-map "<f5>" #'whitespace-mode)
#+end_src

The secret to good keyboard shortcuts is to encode semantic information, so almost all EWS-specific shortcuts start with =C-c w= where the =w= stands for 'writing'. This approach does not always work because you will quickly run out of the most obvious letter.

Some people dislike the Emacs keyboard defaults because they require frequent use of the modifier keys. They suggest that repetitive use of these keys causes strain injury, the dreaded’ Emacs pinky’. Several packages, such as Evil Mode and God Mode, exist within the Emacs ecosystem that change the default keybindings to a different model. 

** Is Emacs a productivity sink?
Configuring Emacs can be a daunting task that can take a lot of time and become a productivity sink because of how easily it can be done. The freedom you enjoy in Emacs means that everybody has personal preferences. Emacs developers cannot cater to every personal preference, so they provide a skeleton system you must develop to suit your workflow. Emacs Lisp is like a box of Lego that you use to create toys. Working on your Emacs configuration is a lot of fun but actually playing with them is even better.

It can be tempting to constantly fine-tune your configuration, but this can become a productivity sink. Wielding the power to create a bespoke Emacs system is a great temptation that can lead to fake productivity, which is one of the three forms of procrastination:

1. /Nihilistic procrastination/: Watching TV and playing computer games.
2. /Sophisticated procrastination/: Fake productivity, e.g. Emacs hacking, switching productivity tools, taking notes for volume instead of quality.
3. /Productive procrastination/: Daydreaming.

Tinkering with your Emacs configuration is not as bad as nihilistic procrastination but can become a form of fake productivity. The productivity gains from fine-tuning your Emacs to cut out a few keystrokes from your workflow can take more time than you will save with your new workflow over the rest of your lifetime. The act of writing is about much more than the number of words you can type into your buffer. Writing is as much a contemplative act as it is about keyboard efficiency.

The EWS configuration will help you reduce the time it takes to configure Emacs to suit your preferred workflow.

* Create functions
If a computer is, in the words of Steve Jobs, a "bicycle for the mind", then Emacs is the Hot Rod of the mind, providing ultimate computing freedom. Writing functions and commands converts your plain /Emacs Writing Studio/ into your personal Hot Rod of computing 

The third step in total computing freedom is writing bespoke functions to undertake tasks specific to your workflow. Most Emacs code exists because a user wants to achieve something that neither Emacs nor any existing package can do. The Emacs way is for you to develop your solution to the problem.

The code that runs Emacs is, for the most significant part, written as a collection of Elisp functions. The simplistic definition of a function is that it converts an input into an output. For example, every time you hit a letter on the keyboard in Emacs, the ~self-insert~ function turns the critical press into a character in the open buffer.

The code below shows the architecture of a simple Emacs function. When you run this function, Emacs will show a greeting in the echo area, extracting your name from the system.

#+begin_src elisp :eval no
  (defun ews-greet-user ()
    "Display a greeting message in the minibuffer."
    (interactive)
    (message "Hello %s, Welcome to Emacs." user-full-name))
#+end_src

Now, let's break down how this function works:

- The function starts with the ~defun~ macro to define a new function. In this case, the name of the function is ~ews-greet-user~. The function name starts with ~ews~ following informal naming conventions. The parenthesis at the end is empty, which means that this function has no input.
- The second line describes what the function does, which shows why Emacs is self-documenting. Each function in the system has a documentation string, which you can read with =C-h v=.
- The ~(interactive)~ part turns the function into a command. This means that you can call it using =M-x ews-greet-user= or bind it to a key sequence.
- The last line places the message in the echo area with the ~message~ function. In this case, the =%s= is replaced by the content of the ~user-full-name~ variable.

You can write this function in the scratch buffer to try it out. Then, you need to activate it by placing the cursor after the last closing parenthesis and using =C-x C-e= (~eval-last-sexp~). This action registers the function in memory so you can call it with =M-x=.

You could add this function to your init file to make it available every Emacs session. However, I doubt its usefulness in this example.

How you use functions is only limited by your imagination. EWS comes with a set of bespoke functions in the =ews.el= file that enhances some of the basic functionality. To see a list of all available EWS commands use =M-x ^ews=. This sequence shows all commands in the minibuffer completion menu that start with (=^=) 'ews'.

* Build a package
The next level of sophistication in Emacs is to share your bespoke functions with the world through a package. Most Emacs packages start with a user trying to solve a problem in their workflow and then deciding to share it with the world.

For example, my package Citar-Denote started with a desire to use Emacs for my bibliographic notes. I had no experience with Emacs coding, but I just had a go anyway. I first published a rudimentary version of Citar-Denote, although I could not figure out how to undertake some tasks. As soon as I shared the code, other people quickly jumped in to assist, and soon, the Citar-Denote package became a fully functional tool to manage bibliographic notes.

* Help others
The final step in becoming an Emacs ninja is helping other people on their journey. You can help fellow users through various online forums, such as Reddit, which has active Emacs communities.

This book started as a website where I shared my use of Emacs as an author. As the website gained popularity, I converted it to the book you are now reading.

The EWS project is my way of giving back to the Emacs community and also helping me better understand how the software works. Some cynics suggest that "those who can't do, teach". However, teaching any subject is the best way to systematise your knowledge and become better at it.

So, your task as an Emacs Ninja is to help other people less advanced in their journey. Tell other authors about the freedom that Emacs gives you as a researcher, author, educator, or whatever else you do.

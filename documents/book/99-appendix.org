#+bibliography: ../emacs-writing-studio.bib
#+startup:      content

This appendix presents and explains the {{{ews}}} (EWS) configuration. The configuration is annotated to explain the logic of the code and provides some options for enhancements or additional functionality. This configuration follows the following principles:

- Leverage functionality of the latest version of GNU Emacs
- Minimalist configuration
- Use standard keyboard shortcuts
- Centred around Org mode
- No configuration for writing code

This configuration is a starting point for your Emacs journey. Feel free to modify any part of the EWS initialisation file and study its effects. You can find the latest version of this configuration on GitHub:

#+begin_example
github.com/pprevos/emacs-writing-studio
#+end_example

This repository is not actively maintained. For beginning Emacs users, the configuration acts as a starting point to develop a configuration. More advanced users can copy ideas. The code will only be updated when there are bugs due to future changes in packages or Emacs itself.

* Using EWS
The first part of the configuration sets the basic principles of the EWS configuration, such as package management, the user interface look and feel, the minibuffer completion system and basic settings to enable writing for humans.

** Basic configuration
The first part of the configuration checks if the latest version of Emacs is running. EWS leverages some of the newest functionality, so you must install this version. Note that the expression or higher ~(< emacs-major-version 29)~ is in Polish notation. In Lisp, the operator is placed before the operands, unlike the more common infix notation, which places the operator between the operands, e.g. ~emacs-major-version < 29~. 

#+begin_src elisp :exports none
  ;; Emacs 29 avaibale?
#+end_src
#+begin_src elisp
  (when (< emacs-major-version 29)
    (error "Emacs Writing Studio requires Emacs version 29 or later"))
#+end_src

Any changes made by the Emacs customisation system in EWS are stored in =custom.el= instead of directly to the init file. This approach prevents the customisation system from modifying the initialisation file. The =custom.el= file is loaded when found. If variables are set in both the custom and the init files, the =init.el= file takes preference.

#+begin_src elisp :exports none
  ;; Custom settings in a separate file and load the custom settings
#+end_src  
#+begin_src elisp
  (setq-default custom-file (expand-file-name "custom.el" user-emacs-directory))

  (load custom-file :no-error-if-file-is-missing)
#+end_src

Keyboard shortcuts defined in EWS all use the =C-c w= prefix. Access the ~customise-variable~ function with the =C-c w v= shortcut.

#+begin_src elisp
  (keymap-global-set "C-c w v" 'customize-variable)
#+end_src

** Emacs packages
Emacs users have developed and shared thousands of packages with the rest of the community. These packages are written in Emacs Lisp and extend its capabilities. This part of the configuration sets the essential elements to load and install packages from the MELPA archive (=melpa.org=).

#+begin_src elisp :exports none
  ;; Set package archives
#+end_src
#+begin_src elisp
  (use-package package
    :config
    (add-to-list 'package-archives
                 '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/"))
    (package-initialize))
#+end_src

This configuration implements John Wiegley's Use-Package. This package simplifies installing and configuring packages with a standardised and easy-to-read method. Software developers call such a tool 'syntactic sugar', which is syntax designed to make code easier to read or write, making the language "sweeter" for humans [cite:@landin_1964].

The Use-Package system consists of a set of statements between parenthesis, which is a macro. In its simplest form, it is something like ~(use-package <package-name>)~. The code can also contain one or more sections to set various options. The =:custom= section below sets three variables. These variables enact three protocols. Any missing package is automatically installed from its online source, and the source code is compiled to speed up Emacs. Thirdly, compilation warnings are kept to a minimum so as not to scare beginning users with log files.

#+begin_src elisp :exports none
  ;; Package Management
#+end_src
#+begin_src elisp
  (use-package use-package
    :custom
    (use-package-always-ensure t)
    (package-native-compile t)
    (warning-minimum-level :emergency))
#+end_src

To read the finer details of the Use-Package macro, read the manual with =C-h R use-package=.

** Emacs Writing Studio functionality
EWS also provides a range of bespoke convenience functions for various aspects of the writing process. Ensure you download this file from the EWS repository.

#+begin_src elisp :exports none
  ;; Load EWS functions
#+end_src
#+begin_src elisp
  (load-file (concat (file-name-as-directory user-emacs-directory) "ews.el"))
#+end_src

The ~ews-missing-executables~ function checks if external software is available on your system. Emacs writes a message in the minibuffer if any of the recommended tools are missing. You can jump to the Messages buffer with =C-h e= to review the output. Emacs will function normally when this software is unavailable, but some features might not work.

The input for this function is a list, a series of strings between parenthesis that starts with a tick symbol: ~'("this" "is" "a" "list")~ The tick prevents Emacs from confusing the list of data with a function. In this function, some lists also contains other lists.

This function checks whether all these packages are available on your system. For software in a nested list, such as =("convert" "gm")=, only one of them has to be available, as these programs are alternatives for the same functionality.

#+begin_src elisp :exports none
  ;; Check for missing external software
  ;;
  ;; - soffice (LibreOffice): View and create office documents
  ;; - zip: Unpack ePub documents
  ;; - pdftotext (poppler-utils): Convert PDF to text
  ;; - ddjvu (DjVuLibre): View DjVu files
  ;; - curl: Reading RSS feeds
  ;; - convert (ImageMagick) or gm (GraphicsMagick): Convert image files  ;; - latex (TexLive, MacTex or MikTeX): Preview LaTex and export Org to PDF
  ;; - hunspell: Spellcheck. Also requires a hunspell dictionary
  ;; - grep: Search inside files
  ;; - gs (GhostScript) or mutool (MuPDF): View PDF files
  ;; - mpg321, ogg123 (vorbis-tools), mplayer, mpv, vlc: Media players
  ;; - git: Version control
#+end_src
#+begin_src elisp
  (ews-missing-executables
   '("soffice"
     "zip"
     "pdftotext"
     "ddjvu"
     "curl"
     ("convert" "gm")
     "latex"
     "hunspell"
     "grep"
     ("gs" "mutool")
     ("mpg321" "ogg123" "mplayer" "mpv" "vlc")
     "git"))
#+end_src

** Look and feel
EWS espouses a minimalist aesthetic to provide a distraction-free environment. The first three lines of code disable the toolbar, the menu bar, and the scroll bar. The menu bar can be useful for beginners, and you can still access it with the =F10= key. If you like to keep the tool, menu, and/or scroll bars, then either remove the relevant lines, change the =-1= to a =1=, or add two semicolons at the start of the relevant lines to convert them to comments.

#+begin_src elisp :exports none
  ;;; LOOK AND FEEL
#+end_src
#+begin_src elisp
  (tool-bar-mode -1)
  (menu-bar-mode -1)
  (scroll-bar-mode -1)
#+end_src

Vanilla Emacs has the slightly paternalistic habit of requiring a single =y= or =n= answer, while on some occasions, it requires you to type =yes= or =no=, due to the perceived higher risk of typing the wrong answer. The ~setq~ function sets the ~use-short-answers~ variable to =t=. If you want to retain this behaviour, change the =t= to =nil=.

In Emacs Lisp, =t= means TRUE and =nil= is equivalent to FALSE. Emacs documentation often mentions setting a value to "non-nil", which is a double negative to suggest setting the variable to true.

#+begin_src elisp :exports none
  ;; Short answers only please
#+end_src
#+begin_src elisp
  (setq-default use-short-answers t)
#+end_src

The next two sections of code further improve the Emacs interface with two packages by Emacs guru Protesilaos Stavrou.

The spacious padding package creates space around windows, preventing crammed text on your screen. The =:init= section contains code Emacs evaluates when loading the package. In this case, it enables the Spacious Padding mode. The =:custom= section also sets the line spacing to a more generous value. You can read the manual for this mode with =C-h R spacious=.

This configuration also modifies the ~line-spacing~ variable to create some space between logical lines. This variable is not part of the Spacious Padding package.

#+begin_src elisp :exports none
  ;; Spacious padding
#+end_src
#+begin_src elisp
  (use-package spacious-padding
    :custom
    (line-spacing 3)
    :init
    (spacious-padding-mode 1))
#+end_src

The next package sets the Emacs theme. A theme is a set of configurations for fonts and colours. Themes are available in two types: light or dark background.

The Modus themes package is highly configurable. This Use-Package declaration contains a three sections. The =:custom= section customises variables used in the package. In this case, we instruct the package to use italic and bold fonts for emphasis and allow for fonts with fixed and variable pitch. The code also slightly increases the size of headings. You can toggle between a dark and a light version of this theme, and the last variable defines which to toggle between. EWS uses the tinted version of the themes, which you can modify.

The =:custom= section of the macro sets some variables to define fonts. This section also defines which themes are toggled when switching between light and dark themes with =C-c w t t=. The default is the tinted versions. If you want your configuration to default to the high-contrast versions or one of the two colour blindness-safe versions, customise the ~modus-themes-to-toggle~ variable. To see the possible options for the Modus themes, use the help file: =C-h v modus-themes-collection=.

The following section binds some keys to commands to toggle between dark and light or select any available modus themes. All EWS custom keybindings start with =C-c w= as the prefix key and =C-c w t= as the prefix key for the theme-related functions. You can obviously change these to suit your preferences. Read the Modus Themes package manual for details with =C-h R modus=.

The ~consult-theme~ command invoke the consult package to help you select between installed themes.

As a bonus, this code also installs Port's Ef-Themes package, which is a wonderful collection of light and dark themes.

To set a default theme, run the ~customize-themes~ command and select your preferred version. Click the button to store your chosen default in the =custom.el= file

#+begin_src elisp :exports none
  ;; Modus and EF Themes
#+end_src
#+begin_src elisp
  (use-package modus-themes
    :custom
    (modus-themes-italic-constructs t)
    (modus-themes-bold-constructs t)
    (modus-themes-mixed-fonts t)
    (modus-themes-to-toggle '(modus-operandi-tinted modus-vivendi-tinted))
    :bind
    (("C-c w t t" . modus-themes-toggle)
     ("C-c w t m" . modus-themes-select)
     ("C-c w t s" . consult-theme)))

  (use-package ef-themes)
#+end_src

The next section hooks the Variable Pitch mode to any Org buffer. This means that written prose is displayed in variable pitch, while metadata, code and other items are in fixed pitch. A hook is a construction in Emacs that associates modes with each other. In this case, variable pitch text is enabled for all text mode buffers.

#+begin_src elisp :exports none
  ;; Mixed-pich mode
#+end_src
#+begin_src elisp
  (use-package mixed-pitch
    :hook
    (org-mode . mixed-pitch-mode))
#+end_src

This last code snippet in the look-and-feel section changes how Emacs automatically split windows to favour vertical splits over horizontal ones to improve readability. This section also installs the Balanced Windows package, which manages window sizes automatically. For example, when you have three open windows and you close one, the remaining windows each get half the screen.

#+begin_src elisp :exports none
  ;; Window management
  ;; Split windows sensibly
#+end_src
#+begin_src elisp
  (setq split-width-threshold 120
        split-height-threshold nil)
#+end_src
#+begin_src elisp  :exports none
  ;; Keep window sizes balanced
#+end_src
#+begin_src elisp
  (use-package balanced-windows
    :config
    (balanced-windows-mode))
#+end_src

** Minibuffer completion
EWS uses the Vertico-Orderless-Marginalia stack of minibuffer completion packages in their standard configuration. Chapter [[#chap-ews]] explains how to use minibuffer completion.

#+begin_src elisp :exports none
  ;; MINIBUFFER COMPLETION

  ;; Enable vertico
#+end_src
#+begin_src elisp
  (use-package vertico
    :init
    (vertico-mode)
    :custom
    (vertico-sort-function 'vertico-sort-history-alpha))
#+end_src
#+begin_src elisp :exports none
  ;; Persist history over Emacs restarts.
#+end_src
#+begin_src elisp
  (use-package savehist
    :init
    (savehist-mode))
#+end_src
#+begin_src elisp :exports none
  ;; Search for partial matches in any order
#+end_src
#+begin_src elisp
  (use-package orderless
    :custom
    (completion-styles '(orderless basic))
    (completion-category-defaults nil)
    (completion-category-overrides
     '((file (styles partial-completion)))))
#+end_src
#+begin_src elisp :exports none
  ;; Enable richer annotations using the Marginalia package
#+end_src
#+begin_src elisp
  (use-package marginalia
    :init
    (marginalia-mode))
#+end_src

** Keyboard shortcuts menu
The Which-Key package improves the discoverability of keyboard shortcuts with a popup in the minibuffer.

Due to the naming conventions in Emacs, most functions start with the package name, so some can be long. The problem is that the most interesting part of a function name is at the end of the string, so we don't want that to be hidden. This configuration widens the columns a bit to prevent truncated function names. This configuration also instructs Which-Key to order the list by function name rather than by key. 

#+begin_src elisp :exports none
  ;; Improve keyboard shortcut discoverability
#+end_src
#+begin_src elisp
  (use-package which-key
    :config
    (which-key-mode)
    :custom
    (which-key-max-description-length 40)
    (which-key-lighter nil)
    (which-key-sort-order 'which-key-description-order))
#+end_src

** Improved help functionality
Emacs is advertised as a "self-documenting text editor". While this is not entirely correct (if only computer code could document itself), every aspect of Emacs is documented within the source code.

Emacs has two levels of help. Firstly, there are the manuals for Emacs itself and some of the packages. Also each individual command and function contains documentation. The Helpful package by Wilfred Hughes adds contextual information to the built-in Emacs help. For example, when asking for documentation about a variable, the help file links to its customisation screen or the source code.

#+begin_src elisp :exports none
  ;; Improved help buffers
#+end_src
#+begin_src elisp
  (use-package helpful
    :bind
    (("C-h f" . helpful-function)
     ("C-h x" . helpful-command)
     ("C-h k" . helpful-key)
     ("C-h v" . helpful-variable)))
#+end_src

** Configure text modes
Emacs is principally designed for developing computer code, so it needs some modifications to enable writing text for humans. The config first ensures that Emacs does not try to install Text-Mode as a package, because it is built-in.

Secondly, we hook Visual Line Mode to Text Mode. Visual Line mode wraps long lines to the nearest word to fit in the current window, as is common in word processing software.

By default, Emacs does not replace text when you select a section and start typing, which is unusual behaviour when writing prose. The =:init= section enables a more common default so that selected text is deleted when typed over. The =:custom= section enables the page-up and page-down keys to scroll to the top or bottom of a buffer. This section also redefines the way Emacs defines a sentence (refer to section [[#sec-count]]). The last variable saves any existing clipboard text into the kill ring for better operability between the operating system's clipboard and Emacs's kill ring.

#+begin_src elisp :exports none
  ;;; Text mode settings
#+end_src
#+begin_src elisp
  (use-package text-mode
    :ensure
    nil
    :hook
    (text-mode . visual-line-mode)
    :init
    (delete-selection-mode t)
    :custom
    (sentence-end-double-space nil)
    (scroll-error-top-bottom t)
    (save-interprogram-paste-before-kill t))
#+end_src

** Spellchecking
Writing without automated spell-checking would be quite annoying, even for the most experienced authors. The Flyspell package interfaces with the Hunspell software and the relevant dictionary to check spelling on the fly.

You must change the standard dictionary to your local variety with the ~ews-hunspell-dictionaries~  variable. EWS uses this particular variable because the dictionaries are set in two places to enable multilingual spelling. You can set multiple dictionaries for the same buffer. In my configuration I use ="en_AU,nl_NL"= so I can write in either the Australian variant of English of Dutch without having to change dictionaries. Section [[#sec-spelling]] explains how to use this package.

#+begin_src elisp :exports none
  ;; Check spelling with flyspell and hunspell
#+end_src
#+begin_src elisp
  (use-package flyspell
    :custom
    (ispell-program-name "hunspell")
    (ispell-dictionary ews-hunspell-dictionaries)
    (flyspell-mark-duplications-flag nil) ;; Writegood mode does this
    (org-fold-core-style 'overlays) ;; Fix Org mode bug
    :config
    (ispell-set-spellchecker-params)
    (ispell-hunspell-add-multi-dic ews-hunspell-dictionaries)
    :hook
    (text-mode . flyspell-mode)
    :bind
    (("C-c w s s" . ispell)
     ("C-;"       . flyspell-auto-correct-previous-word)))
#+end_src

** Ricing Org mode
This part of the configuration sets a bunch of variables to improve the design of Org buffers. To learn what these variables do, use =C-h v= and enter the variable name.

Org has a plethora of variables to change its interface. You can add other variables or remove some to make Org look how you prefer. For example, to enable alphabetical lists and numerals, you must customise the ~org-list-allow-alphabetical~ variable to =t=. This adds =a.=, =A.=, =a)= and =A)= as additional options to number a list.

#+begin_src elisp :exports none
  ;;; Ricing Org mode
#+end_src  
#+begin_src elisp
  (use-package org
    :custom
    (org-startup-indented t)
    (org-hide-emphasis-markers t)
    (org-startup-with-inline-images t)
    (org-image-actual-width '(450))
    (org-fold-catch-invisible-edits 'error)
    (org-pretty-entities t)
    (org-use-sub-superscripts "{}")
    (org-id-link-to-org-use-id t)
    (org-fold-catch-invisible-edits 'show))
#+end_src

The above code snippet hides emphasis markers from view for an uncluttered screen. Emphasis markers are the symbols used to indicate italics, bold and other font decorations, for example =_italic_=. Hiding the syntax of a plain text document is not ideal because it obfuscates essential information. The Org Appear package by Alice P. Hacker shows hidden markers in Org buffers when the cursor is used for an emphasised word, giving us the best of both worlds.

#+begin_src elisp :exports none
  ;; Show hidden emphasis markers
#+end_src
#+begin_src elisp  
  (use-package org-appear
    :hook
    (org-mode . org-appear-mode))
#+end_src

The Org Fragtog package is similar to Org Appear but for LaTeX snippets. It automatically toggles Org mode LaTeX fragment previews as the cursor enters and exits them. By default, the text is small and can become unreadable when changing between dark and light themes.

The =org-format-latex-options= variable controls the way Emacs presents fragments. This variable is a list with properties such as colours and size. The =plist-put= function lets you change options in the list. The foreground and background are set to take the same colour as your text. If you change from dark to light mode or vice versa, you should evaluate the ~org-latex-preview~ function (=C-c C-x C-l=) to change the preview images.

Automated LaTeX previews are disabled because they can delay loading a page and cause trouble when the user does not have LaTeX installed.

#+begin_src elisp :exports none
  ;; LaTeX previews
#+end_src
#+begin_src elisp
  (use-package org-fragtog
    :after org
    :hook
    (org-mode . org-fragtog-mode)
    :custom
    (org-startup-with-latex-preview nil)
    (org-format-latex-options
     (plist-put org-format-latex-options :scale 2)
     (plist-put org-format-latex-options :foreground 'auto)
     (plist-put org-format-latex-options :background 'auto)))
#+end_src

The last package to modify Org buffers is Org Modern. However, most of the features have been switched off because it might be better for beginning users not to hide semantic symbols. You can experiment with changing these settings to change the look and feel of Org buffers. 

#+begin_src elisp :exports none
  ;; Org modern: Most features are disabled for beginning users
#+end_src
#+begin_src elisp
  (use-package org-modern
    :hook
    (org-mode . org-modern-mode)
    :custom
    (org-modern-table nil)
    (org-modern-keyword nil)
    (org-modern-timestamp nil)
    (org-modern-priority nil)
    (org-modern-checkbox nil)
    (org-modern-tag nil)
    (org-modern-block-name nil)
    (org-modern-keyword nil)
    (org-modern-footnote nil)
    (org-modern-internal-target nil)
    (org-modern-radio-target nil)
    (org-modern-statistics nil)
    (org-modern-progress nil))
#+end_src

* Inspiration
** Read e-books
The built-in Doc-View package can read various file formats with the assistance of external software. This configuration increases the resolution of the generated image file and raises the threshold for warning before opening large files to fifty MB ($50 \times 2^{20}$). Section [[#sec-pdf]] explains how to use this package.

Reading PDF files requires the GhostScript or MuPDF package. When the Poppler package is available, you can convert a PDF to text for easier searching and copying. To view DjVu files, you need the DjVuLibre library to parse them.

#+begin_src elisp :exports none
  ;; INSPIRATION

  ;; Doc-View
#+end_src
#+begin_src elisp
  (use-package doc-view
    :custom
    (doc-view-resolution 300)
    (large-file-warning-threshold (* 50 (expt 2 20))))
#+end_src

The Nov package by Vasilij Schneidermann provides valuable functionality for viewing ePub books inside Emacs. The init section ensures that any file with an =epub= extension is associated with this package. An ePub file is essentially a compressed website, so you will need the Zip program to enable reading these files. Refer to section [[#sec-epub]] on how to read ePub files.

#+begin_src elisp :exports none
  ;; Read ePub files
#+end_src
#+begin_src elisp
   (use-package nov
     :init
     (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.epub\\'" . nov-mode)))
#+end_src

Emacs can read documents produced by standard office software. To achieve this, it converts these files to PDF with LibreOffice and presents them as such.

A confirmed bug in Org mode (version 9.6.15) overrides the associations between LibreOffice and Doc View mode. The code below is a workaround for reinstating the desired behaviour and associating the various file extensions with Doc View. This bug fix is optional if you use Org 9.7 and beyond.

#+begin_src elisp :exports none
  ;; Reading LibreOffice files
  
  ;; Fixing a bug in Org Mode pre-9.7
  ;; Org mode clobbers associations with office documents
#+end_src
#+begin_src elisp
  (use-package ox-odt
    :ensure nil
    :config
    (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist
                 '("\\.\\(?:OD[CFIGPST]\\|od[cfigpst]\\)\\'"
                   . doc-view-mode-maybe)))
#+end_src

** Bibliographies
These lines of code add two field types to BibTeX entries: keywords to help you order your literature and a link to a file so you can read any attachments in Emacs.

The ~ews-register-bibtex~ function assigns all =.bib= files in the ~ews-bibliography-directory~ variable to the list of global BibTeX files. You need to set this variable to the location where you store your bibliography. Section [[#sec-bib]] explains creating and managing a bibliography. We use a special variable to ensure other variables have the same value.

#+begin_src elisp :exports none
  ;; Managing Bibliographies
#+end_src
#+begin_src elisp
  (use-package bibtex
    :custom
    (bibtex-user-optional-fields
     '(("keywords" "Keywords to describe the entry" "")
       ("file"     "Relative or absolute path to attachments" "" )))
    (bibtex-align-at-equal-sign t)
    :config
    (ews-bibtex-register)
    :bind
    (("C-c w b r" . ews-bibtex-register)))
#+end_src

The Biblio package enables you to extract literature from various databases.

#+begin_src elisp :exports none
  ;; Biblio package for adding BibTeX records
#+end_src
#+begin_src elisp
  (use-package biblio
    :bind
    (("C-c w b b" . ews-bibtex-biblio-lookup)))

Citar is the workhorse package for managing a bibliography and citations. It provides an interface between your text and the bibliography.

** Reading websites
The Elfeed package helps with reading RSS files, and the Elfeed-Org package lets you configure RSS feeds with an Org file. The EWS repository contains an example file. Read section [[#sec-rss]] for more information on how to use this tool. Elfeed uses the cURL software to download feeds. If this software is unavailable, it will use a slower version built into Emacs.

#+begin_src elisp :exports none
  ;; Read RSS feeds with Elfeed
#+end_src
#+begin_src elisp
  (use-package elfeed
    :custom
    (elfeed-db-directory

** Playing multimedia files
The EMMS (Emacs MultiMedia System) package provides an interface to various multimedia players. You need one of these programs installed: =mpg321=, =ogg123= (vorbis-tools), =mplayer=, =mpv=, or VLC. 

#+begin_src elisp :exports none
  ;; Emacs Multimedia System

** Opening files with external software
The OpenWith package by Markus Trisk lets you open files in external software. Refer to sections [[#sec-openwith]] and [[#sec-find-notes]] for further details.

#+begin_src elisp

    (openwith-mode t)
    :custom
    (openwith-associations nil))
#+end_src

* Ideation
** Org capture
The possibilities for capture templates are extensive and depend on your use cases. This configuration is only an example of the options. The Org documentation provides lots of detail (=C-h R org <ret> capture=). You will also need to customise the ~org-default-notes-file~ variable.

#+begin_src elisp
  ;; Fleeting notes
#+end_src
#+begin_src elisp
  (use-package org
    :bind
    (("C-c c" . org-capture)

        (file+headline org-default-notes-file "Tasks")
        "* TODO %i%?"))))
#+end_src
    
** Denote
Denote is a flexible note-taking and file management package. Refer to [[#sec-denote]] or the extensive Denote manual with =C-h R denote=. At a minimum, you need to configure the ~denote-directory~ variable to indicate the location of your notes.

The EWS package includes a convenience function to improve how Denote displays links to attachments, linked to the ~denote-link-description-function~.

#+begin_src elisp :exports none
  ;; Denote
#+end_src
#+begin_src elisp
  (use-package denote
    :defer t

#+end_src

The Consult package provides some convenience functionality to make life easier.

The ~consult-org-heading~ command provides a table of contents of the Org mode file to quickly move around a large file. The ~consult-grep~ function lets you search through files in the current directory. The search functionality requires access to the Grep software. 

Consult has a lot more functionality that replaces some base Emacs commands with more convenient version. Most of these have not been enabled to ensure we stay as close as possible to vanilla Emacs. The Consult online documentation provides detailed descriptions of these enhanced commands.

#+begin_src elisp :exports none
  ;; Consult convenience functions
#+end_src
#+begin_src elisp
  (use-package consult
    :bind
    (("C-c w h" . consult-org-heading)

#+end_src

Consult Notes is a convenience package that builds on Consult. It provides access to Denote files and also lets you search through your notes.

#+begin_src elisp :exports none

* Production
** Managing the writing process
The EWS repository provides some Org-related convenience files for inserting notes, drawers, and counting words. At this stage, the screenshot command is experimental.

#+begin_src elisp :exports none
  ;; Set some Org mode shortcuts
#+end_src
#+begin_src elisp
  (use-package org
    :bind
    (:map org-mode-map

          ("C-c w c" . ews-org-count-words)))
#+end_src

The Olivetti package removes distractions from the screen and converts your Emacs session to an electronic typewriter. The ~ews-olivetti~ function stores the screen configuration before you activate the distraction-free writing mode. When you disable Olivetti mode with this function then the original configuration is restored.

#+begin_src elisp :exports none
  ;; Distraction-free writing
#+end_src
#+begin_src elisp
  (use-package olivetti
    :demand t
    :bind
    (("C-c w o" . ews-olivetti)))

    :bind
    (("C-c w u" . undo-tree-visualise)))
#+end_src

** Citations
This configuration sets the global bibliography equal to the ~ews-bibtex-files~ variable. To set this variable, configure the ~ews-bibtex-directory~ to register bibliography files and run the ~ews-bibtex-register~ function every time you add new bib-files.

#+begin_src elisp :exports none
  ;; Export citations with Org Mode
#+end_src
#+begin_src elisp
  (require 'oc-natbib)
  (require 'oc-csl)

        org-cite-activate-processor 'citar)
#+end_src

** Quality assurance
Emacs can hook into the dictionary server at =dict.org= and the Powerthesaurus package integrates with =powerthesaurus.org=. Refer to section [[#sec-qa]] for details.

#+begin_src elisp :exports none
  ;; Lookup words in the online dictionary
#+end_src
#+begin_src elisp

The Writegood package helps to detect weasel words, passive writing, and repeated words. It also contains functions to estimate a text's complexity using the Flesch-Kincaid test.

#+begin_src elisp :exports none
  ;; Writegood-Mode for weasel words, passive writing and repeated word detection
#+end_src
#+begin_src elisp

#+end_src

The TitleCase package strives for the most accurate title-casing of sentences, lines, and regions of text in English prose. You can customise the ~titlecase-style~ variable 

The EWS convenience function can do this for all headings in an Org file to ensure consistency (section [[#sec-titlecase]]).

#+begin_src elisp :exports none
  ;; Titlecasing
#+end_src
#+begin_src elisp
  (use-package titlecase

** Abbreviations
Abbrev mode is a built-in program that helps you speed up your writing by defining abbreviations and common spelling mistakes and automatically replacing them with words, sentences, or complete paragraphs.

#+begin_src elisp :exports none
  ;; Abbreviations
#+end_src
#+begin_src elisp
  (add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'abbrev-mode)

The Lorem Ipsum generator can be helpful when designing a document's layout. This package inserts dummy Latin text into a buffer. 

#+begin_src elisp :exports none
  ;; Lorem Ipsum generator

#+begin_src elisp
  (use-package lorem-ipsum
    :custom

    :bind
    (("C-c w s i" . lorem-ipsum-insert-paragraphs)))
#+end_src

** Version control
The built-in Ediff package compares different files and shows their differences. It also lets you decide how to merge the two versions, like a tracked-changes function in a Word processor. The ~ediff~ family of functions does not split its windows nicely by default, so these settings make the program more straightforward to use.

Advanced version control requires a Version Control System, such as Git.

#+begin_src elisp :exports none
  ;; ediff
#+end_src
#+begin_src elisp
  (use-package ediff
    :ensure nil
    :custom

** Other text in modes
Org is fantastic, but it is not the only text mode useful for authors. EWS installs both Markdown and Fountain. Refer to section [[#sec-text-modes]] for details.

#+begin_src elisp :exports none
  ;; Enable Other text modes
  
  ;; Fontain mode for writing scrits

* Publication
** Basic settings
This snippet sets some basic export settings for org mode. You can either set  these as variable to apply them to all files by default, or insert them as keywords in your front matter. 

Read the Export Settings section in to Org manual for a detailed description of the possible configurations.

The timestamp for exporting files is set to the European date format of day, month, and year. If you publish for American audiences, perhaps you like to modify the ~org-export-date-timestamp-format~ to ="%B %e %Y"=. These letters stand for the full name of the month, the day number without leading zero, and the year in four digits. See the documentation of the ~format-time-string~ function for details on how to format dates in other methods.

#+begin_src elisp :exports none

    (org-export-with-smart-quotes t)
    (org-export-date-timestamp-format "%e %B %Y"))
#+end_src

** Epub
The ox-ePub package exports Org files to the most common e-book format. The ~ox-org~  export is required to enable exporting to Org to prevent issues with the table of contents (section [[#sec-ox-epub]]). 

#+begin_src elisp :exports none
  ;; epub export
#+end_src
#+begin_src elisp
  (use-package ox-epub
    :demand t
    :init
    (require 'ox-org))
#+end_src

** Latex
This configuration part defines the export process from Org to TeX to PDF. This setup also removes any temporary files created in the process. You will obviously need a working version of LaTeX with all relevant packages  installed on your computer.

#+begin_src elisp :exports none
  ;; LaTeX PDF Export settings
#+end_src
#+begin_src elisp
  (use-package ox-latex
    :ensure nil
    :demand t

       "bibtex %b"
       "pdflatex -shell-escape -interaction nonstopmode -output-directory %o %f"
       "pdflatex -shell-escape -interaction nonstopmode -output-directory %o %f"))
    ;; Clean temporary files after export
    (org-latex-logfiles-extensions
     (quote ("lof" "lot" "tex~" "aux" "idx" "log" "out"
             "toc" "nav" "snm" "vrb" "dvi" "fdb_latexmk"

             "tex" "bcf"))))
#+end_src

The next part defines the EWS document class, which is used to produce the paperback version of this book.

The first part of the code defines the name used in the Org file, in this case =#+latex_class: ews=. The next par is the preamble in LaTeX code. Note that backslashes need to be escaped by using two of them. Org also adds standard packages, read the documentation for ~org-latex-classes~ for details on how to modify the standard inclusions.

The last section defines how the heading levels in the Org file are translated to LaTeX commands. This code defines the first three Org heading levels.

* Administration
** Getting Things Done
The Org configuration for managing actions and projects sets a custom agenda item that shows the agenda for the next three days, a list of to-do items marked =NEXT=, and a list of items marked =WAIT=.

The ~org-agenda-custom-commands~ variable provides a highly flexible system for crafting agenda views. You could, for example, build an agenda for your private actions and one for your work (section [[#sec-reflect]]).

#+begin_src elisp :exports none
  ;;; ADMINISTRATION

  ;; Bind org agenda command and custom agenda
#+end_src
#+begin_src elisp

#+end_src

** Manage files
The Dired package is a convenient and powerful tool for organising your drives and accessing your information. Dired lists files and directories in alphabetical order. I prefer a different view, which shows directories on top and files below them. The ~dired-listing-switches~ variable determines how files are displayed in a Dired buffer.

The ~dired-dwim-target~ variable instructs to guess a default target directory. This means that if a Dired buffer is displayed in some window, use that directory instead of this Dired buffer's current directory.

The ~delete-by-moving-to-trash~ variable moves deleted files to the wastebasket instead of vanishing them into thin air.

The last line enables opening new directories in the same buffer as the current one (using the =a= key), preventing littering your session with Dired buffers. The first time you use this, Emacs asks you to confirm whether you would like to use this option.

#+begin_src elisp :exports none
  ;; FILE MANAGEMENT
#+end_src
#+begin_src elisp
  (use-package dired
    :ensure
    nil

    (dired-dwim-target t)
    (delete-by-moving-to-trash t)
    :init
    (put 'dired-find-alternate-file 'disabled nil))
#+end_src

The default setting for Dired is to show hidden files, even though they are hidden for a reason. This configuration uses ~dired-omit-mode~ to remove these hidden files from view. You can toggle this behaviour with the full stop key.

#+begin_src elisp :exports none
  ;; Hide or display hidden files
#+end_src
#+begin_src elisp
  (use-package dired
    :ensure nil
    :hook (dired-mode . dired-omit-mode)
    :bind (:map dired-mode-map
                ( "."     . dired-omit-mode))
    :custom (dired-omit-files "^\\.[a-zA-Z0-9]+"))
#+end_src

The ~dired-narrow~ package provides some convenience functions to filter a Dired buffer by a search criterion or a regular expression. 

#+begin_src R
  (use-package dired-narrow)
#+end_src

This next bit of configuration defines how Emacs manages automated backups. The default setting is that the system stores these files in the folder where the original files live, cluttering folders with copies of your stuff.

The setting below modifies the =backup-directory-alist= variable so that Emacs saves all backups (indicated by ="."=) in the =bak= subdirectory of your init folder. Alternatively, you could instruct Emacs not to save backups with ~(setq-default make-backup-files nil)~. I prefer keeping backups as they have saved my bacon a few times.

This configuration also eliminates lock files, which are only useful when working in shared folders. Lock files prevent other users from opening a file when another user is already editing it, but create a lot of clutter when writing by yourself. Change this variable to =t= if you collaborate with others or maintain fles on multiple systems through a file-sharing service such as Nextcloud.

#+begin_src elisp :exports none
  ;; Backup files
#+end_src
#+begin_src elisp

Emacs saves a list of recent files using the =recentf= package. This package maintains a list of recently opened files and makes it easy to visit them. The recent files list is automatically saved across Emacs sessions. By default, the recent files mode stores the last twenty opened files, which you can change by adjusting the ~recentf-max-saved-items~ variable, which in EWS is fifty.

#+begin_src elisp :exports none
  ;; Recent files
#+end_src
#+begin_src elisp
  (use-package recentf
    :config
    (recentf-mode t)
    :custom
    (recentf-max-saved-items 50)
    :bind
    (("C-c w r" . recentf-open)))

This last file package enables you to set bookmarks for your favourite locations. The ~bookmark-save-flag~ is set to one, so the bookmarks file is saved every time you add a new one. The default value only saves it when you exit Emacs, which means you could lose bookmarks in the unlikely event of an Emacs or system crash.

#+begin_src elisp :exports none
  ;; Bookmarks
#+end_src
#+begin_src elisp
  (use-package bookmark
    :custom
    (bookmark-save-flag 1)
    :bind
    ("C-x r d" . bookmark-delete))

** Viewing images
Emacs has two modes for viewing and managing images. The image viewer shows individual images, but you can also browse through a directory with the left and right arrow keys.

To enable image manipulation, you will need to install ImageMagic.

Using =C-<ret>= opens an image in the Dired buffer in your favourite editor. The ~image-dired-external-viewer~ variable defines the program you use to edit pictures, in my case GIMP, the GNU Image Manipulation Program.

#+begin_src elisp
  ;; Image viewer
#+end_src
#+begin_src elisp
  (use-package emacs
    :custom
    (image-dired-external-viewer "gimp")
    :bind
    ((:map image-mode-map
           ("k" . image-kill-buffer)
           ("<right>" . image-next-file)
           ("<left>"  . image-previous-file))
     (:map dired-mode-map
           ("C-<return>" . image-dired-dired-display-external))))
#+end_src

The built-in Image-Dired package can generate thumbnails from within a Dired buffer and let you work on images from there. 

#+begin_src elisp
  (use-package image-dired
    :bind
    (("C-c w I" . image-dired))
    (:map image-dired-thumbnail-mode-map
          ("C-<right>" . image-dired-display-next)
          ("C-<left>"  . image-dired-display-previous)))
#+end_src

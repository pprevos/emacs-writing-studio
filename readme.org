This configuration follows the following principles:
- Leverage functionality in Emacs 29
- Standard keyboard shortcuts
- No configuration for writing code
- Centred around Org mode

Feel free to raise an issue if you have any suggestions on how to enhance the configuration or like to see additional packages useful to authors.

* Install EWS
To install the EWS configuration, download the =init.el= and =ews.el= files from the GitHub repository (=github.com/pprevos/emacs-writing-studio=) and save them in the configuration folder. The location of the configuration folder depends on your operating system and Emacs version. Type =C-h v user-emacs-directory= to identify its location in the popup help buffer. You can close this buffer by pressing =q=. Copy the bot files from the EWS repository to this directory. EWS will activate after you evaluate the ~restart-emacs~ function or the next time you start the program.

If you an experienced Emacs user, then you can try the EWS configuration by creating a separate folder for the init file and start Emacs with =emacs --init-directory <folder-path>=. That way you can try EWS without clobbering your existing configuration.
